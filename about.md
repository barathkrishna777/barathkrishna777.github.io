# About Me

Iâ€™m Barathkrishna Satheeshkumar, currently pursuing my **M.S. in Mechanical Engineering Research at Carnegie Mellon University (2024â€“2026)**.  
My focus lies in **controls, planning, and robotic systems** â€“ from quadrupeds to autonomous vehicles and manipulators.

Previously, I completed my **B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering at IIT Bombay**, where I led the IIT Bombay Racing team to **8th place at Formula Student UK 2022**. After graduation, I worked at **Jaguar Land Rover** as a Vehicle Dynamics Engineer before transitioning to robotics research.

Outside of academics, I enjoy cricket and violin ðŸŽ», having represented Kerala in national tournaments and performed for community outreach programs.
