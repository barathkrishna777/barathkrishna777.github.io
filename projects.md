# Projects

Here’s a selection of projects showcasing my work in robotics, planning, and control:

---

## T-Cap Recycling Robot (CMU Biorobotics Lab, 2025–Present)
- Developed an end-to-end system for **automated e-waste recycling**.  
- Vision pipeline using **YOLO + OCR** for capacitor detection.  
- Integrated UR5 manipulator + pneumatic air-chisel for capacitor removal.  
- Contribution to sustainable robotics applications.

## Hierarchical Motion Planning (CMU, 2025)
- **Problem:** Efficient trajectory planning for high-DoF robotic arms in cluttered environments.  
- **Approach:** Combined Dijkstra-based task-space search with configuration-space sampling.  
- **Impact:** Reduced planning cost by **53%** and time by **35%**, achieving near-optimal trajectories with 70% fewer samples than RRT*.

## RL-Adaptive MPC for Quadrupeds (CMU, 2025)
- Integrated **L1 adaptive control** with reinforcement learning to improve robustness.  
- Achieved **4× jump distance** under doubled payload mass, with better stability and adaptability.  
- Validated on the **Go1 quadruped** in MuJoCo and Isaac Gym.

## MMPUG - Graduate Researcher (CMU, 2024–2025)
- Researched nonlinear control strategies for high-speed autonomous robots.  
- Improved speeds from **3.5 m/s → 6 m/s** using control barrier functions and regularization.  
- Published results through CMU’s MattLab.

## Formula Student – IIT Bombay Racing (2019–2022)
- Led a **110-member team** to design and manufacture an electric race car.  
- Engineered a **planetary gearbox** (24% lighter, same efficiency).  
- Revamped dynamics models, cutting simulation time by 75%.  
- Team placed **8th at Formula Student UK 2022**.
